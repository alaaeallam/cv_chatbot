My name is Alaa Allam. I’m a strategic finance leader, data scientist, and customer experience expert. I’m from Cairo, Egypt, where I’ve built a career bridging business and analytics across telecom, retail, and food sectors.

I’m deeply passionate about using AI to solve real business problems—from predicting customer churn to optimizing financial performance. Outside of work, I’m a big fan of Egyptian street food, but oddly, I can’t stand anything overly sweet—except kunafa with cream, that’s always an exception!
